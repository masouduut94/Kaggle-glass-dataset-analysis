# kaggle-glass-classification-nn-model  

An analysis of kaggle glass dataset as well as building a neural network. 
In this work Neural Network is built with considering optimized parameters 
using hyperopt and hyperas libraries.  I also made use of functions for 
oversampling and undersampling in imblearn library like `SMOTE` and `NearMiss`. 
But it did not get better in neural network performance.
