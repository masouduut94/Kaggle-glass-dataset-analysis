# kaggle-glass-classification-nn-model

An analysis of kaggle glass dataset as well as building a neural network. 
In this work Neural Network is built with considering optimized parameters 
using hyperopt and hyperas libraries. 

I made use of oversampling and undersampling tools from imblearn library like `SMOTE` and `NearMiss`. 
It did not affect the neural netwotk performane but It had huge effect in models in "Data Analysis" file.
